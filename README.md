# hello-world
## My first repository!

I'm also learning how to use ==Markdown==

*Apparently* Discord only allows some aspects of markdown.

I wanted to try a footnote [^1]

I hope it works well! 

Markdown is cool.

[^1] This is supposed to be a footnote :foot: :note:

So far, the footnotes and the subscript haven't seemed to work.
